# Accident-Prone Zone Prediction System

## Introduction
The **Accident-Prone Zone Prediction System** is a machine learning-based application designed to predict accident-prone areas using real-time vehicle sensor data. It processes inputs such as speed, acceleration, gyroscope readings, altitude, and barometric pressure to classify whether an area is prone to accidents and triggers SOS alerts accordingly.

## Features
- **Real-time Data Processing**: Handles live vehicle sensor data.
- **Machine Learning Prediction**: Utilizes advanced models for accident classification.
- **API Integration**: Provides REST API endpoints for seamless integration.
- **Cloud & IoT Connectivity**: Can be deployed on cloud platforms and edge IoT devices.
- **Alert System**: Generates SOS alerts for immediate action.

## Installation
### Prerequisites
Ensure the following dependencies are installed before running the project:
- Python 3.8+
- pip
- Virtual environment (optional but recommended)

### Dependencies
Install required Python packages using:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Required Libraries
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- xgboost
- lightgbm
- tensorflow (for deep learning models)
- flask / fastapi (for API development)
- kafka (for real-time streaming)

## Usage
### 1. Data Preprocessing
Run the following script to clean and preprocess sensor data:
```bash
python preprocess_data.py
```
This script handles missing values, feature extraction, and data normalization.

### 2. Model Training
Train the accident prediction model using:
```bash
python train_model.py
```
This script selects the best machine learning model based on classification performance.

### 3. Model Deployment
Start the API server using Flask or FastAPI:
```bash
python api_server.py
```
This will expose endpoints for real-time accident prediction.

### 4. Making Predictions
Send a POST request with sensor data to the API:
```bash
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8000/predict -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{
  "speed": 60,
  "acceleration": 2.5,
  "gyroscope_x": 0.3,
  "gyroscope_y": 0.1,
  "gyroscope_z": -0.2,
  "barometric_pressure": 1012,
  "gps_accuracy": 3.5,
  "altitude": 50
}'
```
The API will return an accident probability and classification (0: No Accident, 1: Accident).

## API Endpoints
| Endpoint | Method | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| `/predict` | POST | Predicts if an accident is likely based on input sensor data |
| `/retrain` | POST | Retrains the model with new data |

## Deployment
### Cloud Deployment
To deploy on **AWS Lambda**, **Google Cloud Functions**, or **Azure ML**, package the application and deploy it as a REST API.

### IoT Integration
To run on edge devices, optimize the model for low-latency inference and deploy it using **TensorFlow Lite** or **ONNX**.

## Future Enhancements
- **Graph Neural Networks (GNN)** for dynamic accident location analysis.
- **Federated Learning** for collaborative model updates across vehicles.
- **3D GIS Dashboard** for enhanced geospatial visualization.

## Conclusion
The Accident-Prone Zone Prediction System leverages machine learning to improve road safety by identifying hazardous areas and sending real-time alerts. With cloud and IoT integration, it provides a scalable and effective solution for accident prevention.
